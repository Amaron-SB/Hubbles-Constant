# Hubbles-Constant
Objective:
Given 30 observations of the redshifted HŒ± line from different galaxies and the distance to each galaxy, write a program to calculate a value for Hubble‚Äôs constant. The output from the code should be a plot of velocity inferred from redshift vs. distance for each galaxy, the value of Hubble‚Äôs constant inferred from fitting this plot and its uncertainty.

Data:
The file called ‚ÄúHalpha_spectral_data‚Äù contains data for the observed shift of the HŒ± spectral shift. This file is in .csv format. It consists of 4 header rows, below which are 31 rows of data. The first of these rows is frequency in Hz. The first column lists the observation numbers. The remaining rows and columns contain spectral intensity in arbitrary units, with each row corresponding to a different observation.

The file called ‚Äúdistances_Mpc‚Äù is a .txt file in which the first row is a header. It has three columns. The first column is the observation number, the second column is the measured distance to that galaxy in Mpc and the third column is the instrument response. Note that the order of the observation numbers in the ‚Äùdistances_Mpc‚Äù and ‚ÄùHalpha_spectral_data‚Äù files are different.

Project Notes:
The data for spectral intensity versus frequency is noisy. In order to use it to calculate the velocity, the data should first be fitted with a combination of a straight line and a Gaussian function. To fit a Gaussian curve to each spectral pattern, you must write algorithms to calculate initial guesses of the parameters of the Gaussian function. Once the data is fitted, the mean value of the fitted Gaussian (maximum/turning-point) is a good estimate for the observed frequency, from which an observed wavelength, ùúÜo, of the shifted HŒ± line can be calculated.

The instrument response for each observation is either good (corresponding to a value of 1) or bad (corresponding to a value of 0). A bad instrument response can occur if, for example, we have low signal intensity, there is atmospheric interference of the signal or there is a drift in wavelength calibration due to thermal expansion of the instrument. These observations should not be used in the calculation of ùêª0.

Finding the distance for each observation involves matching the observation number in the spectral data file with the observation number in the distance data file since the order of observation numbers is different in both files. You should write Python code to do this matching.
