# Hubbles-Constant
Task:
Given 30 observations of the redshifted Hα line from different galaxies and the distance to each galaxy, write a code in Python to calculate a value for Hubble’s constant. The output from your code should be a plot of velocity inferred from redshift vs. distance for each galaxy, the value of Hubble’s constant inferred from fitting this plot and its uncertainty.
